## Clinical Terms

### Charlson Comorbidity Index
**Definition**: A scoring system (0-24) that predicts 10-year mortality based on presence of chronic conditions

**Scoring**:
- Myocardial infarction: +1
- Congestive heart failure: +1
- Diabetes with complications: +2
- Moderate/severe kidney disease: +2
- Malignancy: +2
- Each 10 years of age over 40: +1

**Interpretation**:
- Score 0-2: Low comorbidity
- Score 3-6: Moderate comorbidity
- Score 7+: High comorbidity

---

### LACE Score
**Definition**: Validated readmission risk tool using 4 factors

**Components**:
- **L**: Length of stay (0-7 points)
- **A**: Acuity of admission (emergency = 3 points)
- **C**: Comorbidity index (0-5 points)
- **E**: Emergency visits in past 6 months (0-4 points)

**Risk Stratification**:
- Score <10: Low risk (9% readmission)
- Score 10+: High risk (20% readmission)

---

### Primary Diagnosis
**Definition**: Main condition responsible for hospital admission

**Examples**:
- Heart Failure
- Pneumonia
- Acute MI (Myocardial Infarction)
- COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease)
- Sepsis
- Stroke

---

### Secondary Diagnosis / Comorbidity
**Definition**: Additional conditions present at admission

**Impact**:
- Increases complexity of care
- Higher risk of complications
- Longer length of stay
- Higher costs

**Common Comorbidities**:
- Hypertension (high blood pressure)
- Diabetes
- Obesity
- Depression
- Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD)

---

## Financial Terms

### DRG (Diagnosis-Related Group)
**Definition**: Payment classification system used by Medicare

**How it works**:
- Hospital receives fixed payment per DRG
- Payment same regardless of LOS or costs
- Incentivizes efficiency

**Example**:
- DRG 291: Heart Failure → $8,500 fixed payment
- Whether patient stays 3 days or 10 days, payment = $8,500
- Hospital keeps difference if costs < payment

---

### Out-of-Pocket (OOP) Ratio
**Definition**: Proportion of bill patient pays directly

**Calculation**:
```
OOP Ratio = Patient Payment ÷ Total Bill
```

**Examples**:
- 0.20 = Patient pays 20%, insurance pays 80%
- 1.00 = Patient pays 100% (uninsured/self-pay)
- 0.05 = Patient pays 5% (Medicaid)

---

### Bad Debt
**Definition**: Amounts owed by patients that are uncollectible

**Typical Bad Debt Rates**:
- Private insurance: 2-5%
- Medicare: <1%
- Medicaid: <1%
- Self-pay: 40-70%

**Accounting Treatment**:
- Initially recorded as accounts receivable
- After collection attempts, written off as bad debt
- Reduces net revenue

---

### Payer Mix
**Definition**: Distribution of patients by insurance type

**Typical Hospital Payer Mix**:
- Medicare: 35-45% (seniors 65+)
- Private insurance: 30-40% (commercial)
- Medicaid: 15-25% (low income)
- Self-pay: 5-10% (uninsured)

**Strategic Importance**:
- Affects overall reimbursement rates
- Influences financial stability
- Guides market positioning

---

### Revenue per Day
**Definition**: Efficiency metric = Total Revenue ÷ Length of Stay

**Interpretation**:
- High Rev/Day = Efficient (procedures, short stay)
- Low Rev/Day = Inefficient (long medical stays)

**Example**:
```
Cardiac cath: $40,000 bill ÷ 2 days = $20,000/day
Rehab: $25,000 bill ÷ 15 days = $1,667/day
```

---

## Operational Terms

### Length of Stay (LOS)
**Definition**: Days between admission and discharge

**Clinical Benchmarks**:
| Condition | Typical LOS |
|-----------|-------------|
| Observation | <24 hours |
| Pneumonia | 3-5 days |
| Heart Failure | 4-7 days |
| Hip Replacement | 2-4 days |
| Stroke | 5-10 days |

**Business Impact**:
- Longer LOS = Higher costs
- DRG payment fixed → Hospital loses money on long stays
- Goal: Medically appropriate shortest LOS

---

- **Home Health**: Nursing visits at home
- **SNF** (Skilled Nursing Facility): Rehab/nursing home
- **Hospice**: End-of-life care
- **AMA** (Against Medical Advice): Patient leaves before ready

**Clinical Significance**:
- Home discharge = good outcome
- SNF = higher complexity, slower recovery
- AMA = high readmission risk

---

### Admission Type
**Definition**: Urgency and planning of hospital admission

**Categories**:
- **Emergency**: Unplanned, urgent (heart attack, trauma)
- **Urgent**: Semi-planned, needed soon (cancer surgery in days)
- **Elective**: Planned, scheduled (knee replacement)

**Risk Implications**:
- Emergency admits have higher readmission risk
- Sicker patients, less time to optimize
- Elective admits are lower risk

---

## Quality Metrics

### 30-Day Readmission Rate
**Definition**: % of patients readmitted within 30 days of discharge

**CMS Calculation**:
```
Readmission Rate = (30-day readmissions ÷ Total discharges) × 100
```

**Industry Benchmarks**:
- Excellent: <15%
- Average: 15-20%
- Poor: >20%

**CMS Penalties**:
- Hospitals with excess readmissions penalized up to 3% of Medicare payments
- Applies to Heart Failure, MI, Pneumonia, COPD, Hip/Knee surgery

---

### Medication Adherence
**Definition**: Degree to which patient follows medication regimen

**Measurement**:

- Costs US healthcare $100-300B annually

**Common Barriers**:
- Cost (can't afford)
- Complexity (too many pills)
- Side effects
- Forgetfulness
